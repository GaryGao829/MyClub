# MyClub
This is a hackthon project
Front End is made up via Oracle JET

For dir webapps, you can put it into tomcat webapps and create a fold named MyClub and put the fold webapps into MyClub. Before you run tomcat, make sure restsql.war exists in $TOMCAT/webapps. Configure the default-restsql.properties and add Activity.xml into sqlresources. Then you can run tomcat and visit localhost:port/MyClub/activity/index.html.
